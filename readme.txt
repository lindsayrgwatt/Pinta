Placeling turns your blog into a map-based, iPhone-enabled guide to your world.

== Description ==

Placeling makes your blog a guide to your world. Each of your blog posts appears on a map plus and each pin on the map links back to that post.

This map can be embedded in your blog, giving your readers a new way to explore your world.

This map can also be seen on an iPhone (via the free Placeling app) so that your readers can literally see nearby places you've written about.

A few specifics:

*   The plugin allows you to tag a location to your post
*   You add a snippet summarizing the location
*   When you publish, the snippet, a link to your post and (optionally) all the photos in the post are sent to Placeling
*   Each blog post includes a footer showing the location and a small map
*   At Placeling.com you can get an embed code to put your map in your blog
*   The [Placeling app](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/placeling/id465502398?mt=8 "Placeling app") is available for free in the iTunes app store

Placeling turns your blog into a mobile guide.

== Description ==

Placeling turns your blog into a mobile guide to the world.

Tag any post or page with a location.

See them all on an automatically created map.

Click or tap on a pin to open up the corresponding post or page in a new window.

Open the map on your phone and the "nearby" button will show blog posts around your current location.

A few specifics:

*   The plugin allows you to tag a location to any post or page. When you publish, a link to your post, a description and (optionally) all the photos in the post are sent to Placeling
*   We create a new page on your blog at the URL /placeling-map/. It contains a map of all your places; you can customize the page and change the URL
*   Each tagged post/page includes a footer showing the location and a small map. Clicking the small map opens the /placeling-map/ page, centered on that location
*   When a reader clicks a pin on the map an info window opens. Clicking the title of the info window opens that post
*   On the map page, clicking the "nearby" button will ask the user for permission to use their location. If granted, the map will pan to their current location

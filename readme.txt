Placeling turns your blog into a map-based, iPhone-enabled guide to the world.

== Description ==

Wouldn't it be great if when your readers walked past that restaurant you wrote about, they could see your blog post?

Or maybe your friends are visiting a city you wrote about on your travel blog - and you want to give them an iPhone-based map of the places you love.

Placeling makes this effortlessly easy.

The Placeling plugin allows you to tag a location to your post (and it's as simple as uploading a photo).

This post then appears on a map of places you love (at Placeling.com/yourusername) and in the free Placeling iPhone app.

Your readers can now explore the world with you as a guide.

A few specifics:
*   The plugin allows you to tag a location to your post
*   You add a snippet summarizing the location
*   When you publish, the snippet, a link to your post and (optionally) all the photos in the post are sent to Placeling
*   Each blog post includes a footer showing the tagged location, its address plus a link to your map at Placeling
